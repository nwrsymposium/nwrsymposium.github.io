            <p>Join us for the inaugural Northwest Robotics Symposium. This free, all day event will bring together
                students,
                postdocs, industry researchers and faculty working in robotics. Forty presenters will share talks and
                posters on papers
                published at robotics conferences over the past couple years. We hope to help make up for two-plus years
                of missed in-person networking as a result of
                the pandemic. In addition to published work, the symposium invited researchers to share unpublished projects. We did not referee these submissions and are not producing an archival proceedings of any of the works presented.</p>

                    of Washington's current guidelines</a>, "wearing a well-fitted, high-quality mask indoors (e.g.,
                    KN95, N95, KF94 and surgical masks)" is strongly recommended. If you have symptoms of any
                    respiratory infection, do not attend the symposium.

            <h2>Instructions for Presenters</h2>
            <p>All presenters have been contacted with the format of their presentation and with instructions on how to
                prepare.</p>
            <h4>Posters</h4>
            <p>We will have 32x39 poster boards (which you can orient either way) and clips for you. If you are
                preparing a fresh poster, we recommend a size of 24x36. If you are bringing an existing poster thatâ€™s
                larger than our poster boards, let us know so we can plan to accommodate it. We encourage you to set up
                your poster during the check-in period so that attendees can look at them throughout the event.</p>
            <h4>Talks</h4>
            <p>Please prepare for an 8-minute presentation, with 2 additional minutes for questions. We intend to have a
                single machine hooked up the projector in the event space which we will ask you to load your slides onto
                before the start of the session.</p>
